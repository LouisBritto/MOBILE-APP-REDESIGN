# DESCRIPTION
            The mobile application screens depict a sleek, dark-themed interface for an audio streaming platform named "Studio Shodwe." The first screen warmly invites users with a “Let’s Get Started!” message and offers options to sign in via email or phone, complemented by a vibrant pink gradient button and a sleek global map backdrop. The second screen allows returning users to log in with email and password, highlighting a 30-day memory feature and a "Forgot Password?" link for recovery. The third screen, "Create an Account!", provides new users a clean sign-up form with fields for username, email, password, and confirm password, continuing the visual consistency and modern aesthetic. Following this is the home screen that welcomes users back, displaying a search bar and a colorful grid of content categories like Telugu, Tamil, Punjabi, Podcast Charts, and Business & Technology. This screen visually balances function and color, enabling users to easily discover new content. The final screen focuses on music playback, with the selected category (Tamil) featured prominently above player controls, including like, add, and share buttons. A playback bar with previous, play/pause, and next controls is clearly visible, ensuring intuitive media navigation. Overall, the design uses a rich dark background contrasted by vibrant gradients and bold typography, creating a professional yet inviting atmosphere. The uniform use of brand elements—like the logo and purple-pink gradient buttons—ensures strong identity throughout. From onboarding to content exploration and playback, the UI effectively guides the user journey with clarity, accessibility, and visual appeal, making "Studio Shodwe" a compelling and user-friendly digital audio experience.
